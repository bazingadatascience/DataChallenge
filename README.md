# DataChallenge
This repository hosts the code for the 2020 DBL Data Challenge. Analyzing 35GB of Tweets related to 13 airlines, our team will find general trends, develop suggestions on how to gain a better public image, and what a specific airline can do in order to satisfy their clients.  
## Setup
Create a secrets.py file in the root directory of the notebook and add the private MongoDB connection string as variable `conn_string`.
