# DataChallenge
This repository hosts the code for the 2020 DBL Data Challenge. Analyzing 35GB of Tweets related to a number of Dutch Airlines, our group will find general trends, develop suggestions on how to gain a better public image, and what a specific airline can do in order to satisfy their clients.
